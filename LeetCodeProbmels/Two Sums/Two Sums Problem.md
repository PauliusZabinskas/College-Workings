The problem presented is asking to return an index of two values that add up to a target value if solution exists.

I have developed two approaches to this solution categorized by O(n).

1. [[Big O(n^2)]] iterates over two loops to find find if currently **I** iterator is equal to inner loop value of **J**. 
2. [[Big O(n)]] leverages [[HashMap]] data type. populating the HashSet with values that have been iterated over by the **for** loop.
