IP Pool Creation:

add name=dhcp_pool0 ranges=192.168.100.2-192.168.100.254;
This command creates a DHCP pool named dhcp_pool0 with a range of IP addresses from 192.168.100.2 to 192.168.100.254.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Configuration:

There are several commands here that configure OSPF, an interior gateway protocol used for routing within larger autonomous systems.
IP Address Assignment:

add address=192.168.100.1/24 interface=ether4 network=192.168.100.0;
add address=10.0.1.1/24 interface=ether2 network=10.0.1.0;
add address=10.0.3.1/24 interface=ether3 network=10.0.3.0;
These commands assign IP addresses to ether4, ether2, and ether3 interfaces.
DHCP Server Network Configuration:

add address=192.168.100.0/24 dns-server=8.8.8.8 gateway=192.168.100.1;
This configures network settings for the DHCP server, setting a DNS server and gateway.
